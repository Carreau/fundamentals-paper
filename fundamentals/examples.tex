\subsection{Ecosystem}
% Cycamore library
% Cyder?

The archetypes created by user-developers and the archetypes provided in the 
\Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014} repository of additional modules 
together form an `ecosystem' of capabilities. Since the long term vision for 
the \Cyclus framework includes an ever-expanding ecosystem of both general and 
specialized capability extensions within that ecosytem. The early growth and 
cross-institutional contributions to this ecosystem demonstrates a significant 
acheivement by the \Cyclus framework. 

\subsubsection{The Cyclus Additional Modules Repository}

\Cycamore, the \Cyclus additional modules repository, provides a fundamental 
set of agent archetypes for basic simulation functionality within \Cyclus.
Since the \Cyclus framework relies on external archetypes to represent the 
agents within a simulation, 
\Cycamore provides the basic archetypes a new user needs to get started running 
simple simulations. 
These archetypes support a minimal set of fuel cycle simulation goals and 
provide, by example, a guide to new developers who would seek to contribute 
their own archetypes outside of \Cycamore.

\subsubsection{External Modules}
External modules have been 
\cite{cyder,separations,streamblender,mktdriveninst,commodconverter} and are 
being \cite{britelite,utk} developed for contribution to the cyclus ecosystem 
of models. 



\subsection{Simulations}
%FCO example (will be done soon.. publishable?)
%Inpro example (is this still running or did we deprecate it with 1.0?)

% MJG - INPRO should be tried again. @rwcarlsen has been running lots of
% simulations with the batch reactor, and its the second generation of my
% reactor models. We could easily use the same demand schedule and enrichment
% facility parameters and run it again.

\TODO{discuss FCO?}

Results of some simple recycle scenarios run in \Cyclus follow.  In \Cyclus,
because material is tracked as discrete objects, single-pass MOX recycle is
easy to implement.  The simulation initially included one provider of fresh
UOX fuel, one recycled fuel fabrication facility, one reactor, one separations
facility, and one repository. The simulation duration was set to 1100 months.

The \Class{BatchReactor} archetype from \Cycamore has the ability to accept
fuel materials from an arbitrary number of different sources dilineated by
commodity. Custom, non-uniform preferences can be set for each different fuel
commodity.  The dynamic resource exchange makes it easy for a reactor to
preferrentially accept recycled MOX fuel over fresh UOX fuel.  The
\Class{BatchReactor} was configured to run with a 3 batch core on 18 month cycles and
a 2-month refueling period.  Adjusting and setting parameters such as these is
as simple as editing numbers in an input file such as:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
  ...
  <BatchReactor>
      ...
      <processtime>18</processtime>
      <nbatches>3</nbatches>
      <batchsize>20000</batchsize>
      <refueltime>2</refueltime>
      ...
  </BatchReactor>
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

The \Class{Source} and \Class{Sink} modules from \Cycamore were also used as a
source of fresh, enriched uranium and a repository respectively. A simple
custom recycled fuel fabrication facility was used.  This fabrication facility
mixes fissile and fertile streams to match target fuel compositions as closely
as possible.  The method used for this matching is approximately the same as
that used by the Cosi fuel cycle simulator \TODO{cite COSI equivalence
method}. The material flows for this simulation are shown below in figure
\ref{fig:flow-modopen}.

To switch to a fully closed fuel cycle, all that needs to be done is change
the output commodity for the \Class{BatchReactor}'s spent MOX fuel.  All this
requires is a one-word change in the input file: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=diff]
  --- mod-open-1.xml	2014-10-08 08:31:33.892523173 -0500
  +++ closed-1.xml	2014-10-08 08:31:33.892523173 -0500
  @@ -108,7 +108,7 @@
           <fuel>         
             <incommodity>mox_fuel</incommodity>

             <outrecipe>mox_spent_fuel</outrecipe>
           </fuel>
\end{lstlisting}

This results in new the material flows in Figure \ref{fig:flow-closed}. Note
that because the \Class{BatchReactor} always transmutes fuel into the same
composition, the nuclide level flows are not very realistic for the full, multipass
recycle case.
