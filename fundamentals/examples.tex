\section{Examples}
% Organize this section according to major topics
% give each topic a section heading in boldface.
% try to cover the major common points :
%
% problem design
% methods of measurement
% supporting models
% supporting data
% simulations run
% results

% Just write the section headings for each part and indicate what goes in that
% section with words :
%
% heading
% figures (with captions)
% schematics (with captions and footnotes)
% equations
% tables

% What does it mean?
% What did I actually test?
% What were the results?
% Did the work yield a new method?
% Did the work yield new knowledge?
% What measurements did I make?
% How were these measurements characterized?
% What methods were used?
% What were the results?
% How were the measurements made and characterized?

Current and past simulations with the Cyclus simulator have already 
demonstrated a range of uses. 

\subsection{Ecosystem}
% Cycamore library
% Cyder?


External modules have been (cite cyder, separations, streamblender, demandinst, 
commodconverter, etc.) and are being (cite brightlight, UTK module, etc.) 
developed for contribution to the cyclus ecosystem of models. 


\subsection{Simulations}
%FCO example (will be done soon.. publishable?)
%Inpro example (is this still running or did we deprecate it with 1.0?)

% MJG - INPRO should be tried again. @rwcarlsen has been running lots of
% simulations with the batch reactor, and its the second generation of my
% reactor models. We could easily use the same demand schedule and enrichment
% facility parameters and run it again.

Simulations have been run in the past and more are being run. FCO is an 
example.
