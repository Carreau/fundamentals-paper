	title = {Studying international fuel cycle robustness with the {GENIUSv}2 discrete facilities/materials fuel cycle systems analysis tool},
	abstract = {{GENIUSv}2 is a discrete-facilities/discrete-materials nuclear fuel cycle systems analysis tool currently under development at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is designed not only to compute the capacity and mass flow data produced by other study tools but also to model the complex relationships between nuclear fuel cycle facilities; the institutions that own them; and the national, intranational, and/or transnational regions in which they operate. This paper describes novel modeling capabilities and methodological contributions present in {GENIUSv}2, including its treatment of the region-institution-facility hierarchy and its optimization-compatible framework. We then present a number of test problems designed to demonstrate the code’s ability to closely reproduce results from another study tool (Idaho National Laboratory’s {VISION} code) and to richly model multi-region scenarios not easily captured by the data models of other codes currently available.},

	title = {Global Evaluation of Nuclear Infrastructure Utilization Scenarios ({GENIUS})},
	abstract = {A new and unique fuel cycle systems code has been developed. Need for this analysis tool was established via methodical development of technical functions and requirements followed by an evaluation of existing fuel cycle codes. As demonstrated by analysis of {GNEP}-type scenarios, the {GENIUS} code discretely tracks nuclear material from beginning to end of the fuel cycle and among any number of independent regions. Users can define scenarios starting with any/all existing reactors and fuel cycle facilities or with an ideal futuristic arrangement. Development and preliminary application of {GENIUS} capabilities in uncertainty analysis/propagation and multi-parameter optimization have also been accomplished.},
