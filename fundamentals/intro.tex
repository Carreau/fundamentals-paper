\subsection{Background}

% Who else has done what?
% How did they do that?
% What did we do before this?
% What is new?

% Common goals of fuel cycle simulation/simulators (driving r&d focus,
% approximating tech. impacts, etc.)
% Previous work (cite all the tools!)
% Limitations of previous simulators by others (fleet-based, closed
% development, inflexible infrastructure)
% Previous attempts by this group (GENIUS v1/v2)
% note NGFCS

\subsection{Motivation}
\subsubsection{Modular Architecture}
% Motivation for encapsulated plug-in architecture 
% enables ecosystem, ease of contribution across institutions
% enables myriad levels of simulation fidelity
% enables FC analyses that can compare â€˜apples to apples'
\subsubsection{Agent-based Paradigm}
% superior detail in capturing simulation dynamics
% more flexible control over behavior
% describe Region/Institution/Facility hierarchy
% note importance of generic resource exchange paradigm
\subsubsection{Discrete Resource Tracking}
% enables more realistic models and metrics
% material routing metrics
% shadow fuel cycles
% etc.
