As nuclear power expands both domestically and internationally, nuclear fuel cycle
performance analysis on technical, economic, political, and environmental axes increases 
in importance. Appropriate nuclear fuel cycle analysis requires calculation of myriad physical, nuclear, 
chemical, industrial, and political phenomena. Nuclear fuel cycle simulators 
therefore couple complex systems such as nuclear process physics, 
facility deployment, and material routing. However, most nuclear fuel cycle 
simulators have not incorporated modern insights from simulation science and 
software architecture that can enable more efficient, accurate, robust, and 
validated analysis. 

The \Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and 
its modeling ecosystem address this need for a next-generation nuclear fuel cycle 
simulator. This dynamic simulator employs discrete agents, time, and isotopic resolution of materials 
and supports a range of analysis types, levels of 
detail, and analyst sophistication.
Additionally, \Cyclus employs a modular architecture and 
open development process that supports user access and 
encourages developer extensions.

Historically, nuclear fuel cycle simulators have estimated 
nuclear fuel cycle performance using software 
ranging from ad hoc spreadsheet-driven flow calculators to highly specialized 
system dynamics
proprietary models. To date, current tools are either static, fleet-based, 
privately distributed, or all of the above. Each of these qualities presents a 
severe challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and 
scientific transparency. 

An alternative to these approaches is a dynamic, agent-based simulator with an 
open platform and an ecosystem of research-driven capabilities.  
Dynamic nuclear fuel cycle analysis more realistically 
supports a range of simulation goals than static analysis 
\cite{piet_dynamic_2011}. Similarly, experience in the broader field of systems 
analysis indicates that agent-based modeling enables more flexible simulation 
control, without loss of generality \cite{macal_agent-based_2010}. Finally, openness 
allows cross-institutional collaboration, increases code robustness, and 
cultivates an ecosystem of modeling and calculation options 
\cite{softwarecarpentryresource}.  The fundamental concepts of the \Cyclus 
nuclear fuel cycle simulator capture these modern insights so that challenges 
in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed.

Nuclear fuel cycle simulators drive \gls{RDD} by calculating `metrics', 
quantitative measures of performance that 
can be compared among fuel cycle options. The feasibility of technology 
strategies, dynamics of transitions between fuel cycles, and many other 
measures of performance can be expressed in terms of these metrics. For example, 
economic feasibility is often measured in \gls{LCOE}, requiring calculation of
lifetime fuel costs and electricity generation, 
while environmental performance might be measured in spent fuel volume, 
  toxicity, or mined uranium.

Historically, the national laboratories have driven development and regulated 
the use of their own fuel cycle simulation tools: \gls{VISION}\cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010}, 
\gls{ORION}\cite{worrall_scenario_2007},
\gls{DANESS}\cite{van_den_durpel_daness_2009}, 
\gls{DYMOND}\cite{yacout_modeling_2005}, and 
\gls{NFCSim}\cite{schneider_nfcsim:_2005}. 
Outside the national laboratories, researchers have created new nuclear fuel cycle 
simulation tools when existing tools were not available or not sufficiently 
general to calculate their metrics of interest with their method of choice.  
With limited access to the national laboratory tools and a need to customize 
them for research purposes, universities and private industry researchers have 
``reinvented the wheel'' by developing tools of their own from scratch and 
tailored to their own needs, for example 
\gls{CAFCA}\cite{guerin_impact_2009} and
\gls{COSI}\cite{boucher_cosi_2005,boucher_cosi:_2006,meyer_new_2009,coquelet-pascal_comparison_2011}. 

This trend has resulted in a proliferation of specialized
fuel cycle simulators for the calculation of fuel cycle metrics.  Accordingly, methods 
for calculating those metrics vary among simulators. Some model the 
system of facilities, economics, and materials in static equilibrium, while 
other simulators capture the dynamics of the system.  
Similarly, while some simulators discretely model material and facilities, 
others treat materials as streams and facilities as fleets, in an aggregated 
fashion. Simulators often overspecialize, 
modeling a single aspect of the fuel cycle in great detail while neglecting 
others. For example, a simulator created for policy modeling might have excellent 
capability in economics while material isotopics and transmutation detail are 
neglected.

\Cyclus emerged from a line of tools seeking to break this practice.  
Its precursor,
\gls{GENIUSv1}\cite{dunzik-gougar_global_2007,jain_transitioning_2006}, began
as an \gls{LDRD} project within \gls{INL} and sought 
\gls{ORION}\cite{}, and 
to provide generic regional capability.  Based on lessons learned from 
Version 1, the 
\acrshort{GENIUSv2} Version 2\cite{oliver_studying_2009,huff_geniusv2_2009} code sought to 
provide more generality and an extensible interface to facilitate 
collaboration.  The \Cyclus project then improved upon the \acrshort{GENIUSv2} 
effort by implementing increased modularity and encapsulation.  The result is  
a dynamic simulator that treats both materials and facilities discretely, with 
an architecture that permits simulations with multiple and variable levels of 
fidelity. The simulator's agent-based framework for tracking the 
transformation and trade of resources between facilities within institutions 
and regions greatly improves upon the existing fuel cycle simulators.

\subsection{Motivation}
% Gently reiterate the above need. 
% There should be a hero narrative here
% There was a gap in the capabilities of simulators.
% \Cyclus, a hero, came in to fill that gap. 

In addition to providing the fundamental features expected in fuel cycle 
simulators, the \Cyclus paradigm enables essential capabilities that previous 
simulators lack. Critically, its \emph{modular and open architecture}  facilitates 
targeted contribution and collaboration within the nuclear fuel cycle analysis 
community.  Additionally, \emph{agent interchangeability} facilitates direct 
comparison of modeling methodologies. Finally, the flexibility and generality 
of its \emph{\gls{ABM}} paradigm and \emph{discrete, object-oriented approach} 
enables \Cyclus to be applicable to a broader range of 
fidelities, scales, and applications than to other simulators. 

\Cyclus separates the problem of modeling a
physics-dependent supply chain into two distinct components: a simulation kernel and archetypes that
interact with the kernel. The kernel is responsible for the
deployment and interaction logic of entities in the simulation.  Physics calculations and 
customized behaviors are implemented within archetypes. Accordingly, specialists
in a given field can utilize their time and resources in modeling a specific
process associated with the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g., reprocessing and advanced
fuel fabrication), without having to model the entirety of the cycle.

Furthermore, modeling the evolution of a physics-dependent, international nuclear fuel supply
chain is a multiscale problem, and existing tools are not sufficiently 
multiscale. Tools have either focused on macro effects, e.g., the fleet-level
stocks and flows of commodities, or micro effects, e.g., the used-fuel
composition of fast reactor fuel. Each focus has driven the
development of specialized tools, rendering the task of answering questions between
the macro and micro levels challenging within a single tool. 
In contrast, the extensible architecture and discrete object tracking of \Cyclus allow
the creation and interchangeability of custom archetypes at any level of fidelity.
