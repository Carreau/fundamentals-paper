As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental
analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. The
merits of advanced nuclear technologies and fuel cycles are
shaped by myriad physical, nuclear, chemical, industrial, and political
factors. Nuclear fuel cycle simulators must therefore couple complex models of
nuclear process physics, facility deployment, and material routing.

Indeed, the cardinal purpose of a dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulator is to calculate
the time- and facility-dependent mass flow through all or part the fuel cycle.
Dynamic nuclear fuel cycle analysis more realistically supports a range of
simulation goals than static analysis \cite{piet_dynamic_2011}. Historically,
dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulators have calculated fuel cycle mass balances
and performance metrics derived from them using software ranging from
spreadsheet-driven flow calculators to highly specialized system dynamics
modeling platforms.

To date, current tools are typically distributed under restrictive rather than open
source licenses, having been developed in industrial contexts or using 
commercial software platforms. Additionally, having
often been developed for customized applications, many possess inflexible
architectures, never having been designed to enable new features or extensions.
Finally, many model only fleet-level dynamics of facilities and
materials rather than discrete resolution of those individual agents and
objects. When the DOE-NE Fuel Cycles Technologies Systems Analysis Campaign
developed requirements necessary in a next generation fuel cycle simulator,
three main failure modes were associated with those software choices.
First, they discourage targeted
contribution and collaboration among experts. Next, they hobble efforts to
directly compare modeling methodologies. Finally, they over-specialize,
rendering most tools applicable to only a subset of desired simulation
fidelities, scales, and applications. Those three constraints were identified
as presenting significant challenges to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency,
robustness, and scientific transparency in the field of fuel cycle analysis
\cite{huff_next_2010}.

The \Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its \emph{modeling
ecosystem}, the suite of agents and other physics plug-in libraries compatible with it,
incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture
to solve these problems.  These modern methods simultaneously enable more
efficient, accurate, robust, and validated analysis.  This next-generation fuel
cycle simulator is the result of design choices made to:

\begin{itemize}
\item support access to the tool by fuel cycle analysts and other users,
\item encourage developer extensions,
\item enable plug-and-play comparison of modeling methodologies,
\item and address a range of analysis types, levels of detail, and analyst sophistication.
\end{itemize}

\Cyclus is a dynamic, agent-based model, which employs a modular architecture,
an open development process, discrete agents, discrete time, and arbitrarily
detailed isotopic resolution of materials. Experience in the broader field of
systems analysis indicates that agent-based modeling enables more flexible
simulation control, without loss of generality
\cite{macal_agent-based_2010}. Furthermore, openness allows cross-institutional
collaboration, increases software robustness
\cite{cohen_modern_2010,fagan_design_2002}, improves
the strength and quality of results through peer review
\cite{donoho_reproducible_2009,ince_case_2012,stodden_scientific_2010,wicherts_willingness_2011,petre_code_2014}, and
cultivates an ecosystem of modeling options. This ecosystem is \emph{modular},
being comprised of dynamically loadable, interchangeable, plug-in libraries of fuel cycle component
process physics that vary in their scope, depth, and fidelity. This modularity
allows users and developers to customise \Cyclus to analyze the cases that are
of interest to them rather than any custom application the simulator was
originally developed to address. Additionally, that customizability allows
users and developers to address those cases at the level of fidelity necessary
for their application. The fundamental concepts of the \Cyclus
nuclear fuel cycle simulator capture these modern insights so that novel
challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed.

Nuclear fuel cycle simulators drive \gls{RDD} by calculating `metrics',
quantitative measures of performance that can be compared among fuel cycle
options.  The feasibility of the technology development and deployment
strategies which comprise a fuel cycle option, the operational features of
nuclear energy systems, the dynamics of transitions between fuel cycles, and
many other measures of performance can be expressed in terms of these metrics.
For example, economic feasibility is often measured in \gls{LCOE}, a
combination of fuel and operating costs normalized by electricity generation, while
environmental performance might be measured by spent fuel volume, radiotoxicity, or
mined uranium requirements. A meta-analysis of fuel cycle systems studies 
identified over
two dozen unique quantitative metrics spanning economics and cost,
environmental sustainability and waste management impacts, safety, security and
nonproliferation, resource adequacy and utilization, among others
\cite{flicker_evaluation_2014}. With few exceptions, these metrics are derived from
mass balances and facility operation histories calculated by a fuel cycle
simulator. For example, where nuclear waste repository burden is derived from
ejected fuel masses, water pollution or land use can be derived from facility
operational histories (as in \cite{poinssot_assessment_2014}).

However, methods for calculating those metrics vary among simulators. Some
model the system of facilities, economics, and materials in static equilibrium,
while other simulators capture the dynamics of the system.  Similarly, while
some simulators discretely model batches of material and individual facilities,
others aggregate facilities into fleets and materials into streams. Some
simulators were designed to model a single aspect of the fuel cycle in great
detail while neglecting others. For example, a simulator created for policy
modeling might have excellent capability in economics while capabilities for
tracking transformations in material isotopics and the effects of isotopics on
technology performance are neglected.  The \gls{CAFCA}\cite{guerin_impact_2009}
simulator is problem-oriented in this way, having elected to neglect isotopic
resolution in favor of integral effects.

Historically, domestic national laboratories have driven development and
regulated the use of their own tools:
\gls{VISION}\cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010},
\gls{DYMOND}\cite{yacout_modeling_2005}, and
\gls{NFCSim}\cite{schneider_nfcsim:_2005,allan_guidance_2008}.  Internationally,
other laboratories have created their own as well, such as
\gls{COSI}\cite{boucher_cosi_2005,boucher_cosi:_2006,meyer_new_2009,coquelet-pascal_comparison_2011}
and ORION\cite{worrall_scenario_2007}.  Finally, some simulators initiated in a national lab setting have
been continued as propriety, industry-based simulators, such as
\gls{DANESS}\cite{van_den_durpel_daness_2009}.  Outside the national laboratories,
researchers have created new nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools when existing
tools were not available or not sufficiently general to calculate their metrics
of interest.  With limited access to the
national laboratory tools and a need to customize them for research purposes,
universities and private industry researchers have ``reinvented the wheel'' by
developing tools of their own from scratch and tailored to their own needs.
Examples include \gls{CAFCA}\cite{guerin_benchmark_2009} and
\gls{DESAE}\cite{andrianova_desae_2008,mccarthy_benchmark_2012,allan_guidance_2008}.

\Cyclus emerged from a line of tools seeking to break this practice.  Its
precursor, \gls{GENIUS} Version 1
\cite{dunzik-gougar_global_2007,jain_transitioning_2006}, originated within
\gls{INL} and sought to provide generic regional capability.  Based on lessons
learned from \gls{GENIUS} Version 1, the \gls{GENIUS} Version 2
\cite{oliver_studying_2009,huff_geniusv2_2009} simulator sought to provide more
generality and an extensible interface to facilitate collaboration.  The \Cyclus
project then improved upon the \gls{GENIUS} effort by implementing increased
modularity and encapsulation.  The result is a dynamic simulator that treats
both materials and facilities discretely, with an architecture that permits
multiple and variable levels of fidelity. Using an agent-based framework, the
simulator tracks the transformation and trade of resources between autonomous
regional and institutional entities with customizable behavior and
objectives. Each of these concepts (agent-based, resource tracking, and
regional as well as institutional entities) will be described in their own
sections (sections \ref{sec:abm}, \ref{sec:mats}, and \ref{sec:rif}
respectively).  Together, they provide a capability for extension and reuse
beyond that pursued by any existing fuel cycle simulator.


\subsection{Motivation}
% Gently reiterate the above need.
% There should be a hero narrative here
% There was a gap in the capabilities of simulators.
% \Cyclus, a hero, came in to fill that gap.

The \Cyclus paradigm enables targeted contribution and collaboration within the
nuclear fuel cycle analysis community to achieve two important goals: lower the
barrier for users to include custom nuclear technologies and facility types in 
their fuel cycle
analyses while improving the ability to compare simulations with and without
those custom concepts.  This essential capability is absent in
previous simulators where user customization and extensibility were not design
objectives.  While the \emph{modular and open architecture} of
\Cyclus is necessary to meet these goals, it is not sufficient.
\emph{Agent interchangeability} is also required to facilitate direct comparison
of alternative modeling methodologies and facility concepts. With this concept
at its core, \Cyclus provides a platform for users to quickly develop the
capabilities at a level of detail and validation necessary for their
unique applications.  Finally, \Cyclus is applicable to a broader range of
fidelities, scales, and applications than other simulators, due to the
flexibility and generality of its \emph{\gls{ABM}} paradigm and \emph{discrete,
object-oriented approach}.

This structure recognizes that specialists should utilize their time and
resources in modeling the specific process associated with their area of
expertise (e.g., reprocessing and advanced fuel fabrication), without having to
create a model of the entire fuel cycle to serve as its host.  \Cyclus supports
them by separating the problem of modeling a physics-dependent supply chain into
two distinct components: a simulation kernel and archetypes that interact with
it. The kernel is responsible for supporting the deployment and
interaction logic of entities in the simulation.  Physics calculations and
customized behaviors of those entities are implemented within \emph{archetype}
classes.

Ultimately, modeling the evolution of a physics-dependent, international
nuclear fuel supply chain is a multi-scale problem which existing tools cannot
support. They have either focused on macro effects, e.g., the fleet-level
stocks and flows of commodities, or micro effects, e.g., the used-fuel
composition of fast reactor fuel. Each focus has driven the development of
specialized tools, rendering the task of answering questions between the macro
and micro levels challenging within a single tool.  In contrast, the open, extensible
architecture and discrete object tracking of \Cyclus allow the creation and
interchangeability of custom archetypes at any level of fidelity and by any
fuel cycle analyst.
