In nuclear fuel cycle simulation it is necessary to calculate and optimize 
nuclear process physics, facility deployment, material routing, etc. 

% MJG - I'm hesitant about using the phrase 'full detail'. I think we can be
% more precise.

Historically, nuclear fuel cycle simulators have addressed this with software 
ranging from spreadsheet driven flow calculators to full detail industrial 
models. 

An alternative to these approaches is a dynamic, agent-based simulator with an 
free, openly accessible simulation-logic kernel.

\subsection{Background}

% Who else has done what?
% How did they do that?
% What did we do before this?
% What is new?

% Common goals of fuel cycle simulation/simulators (driving r&d focus,
% approximating tech. impacts, etc.)
% Previous work (cite all the tools!)
% Limitations of previous simulators by others (fleet-based, closed
% development, inflexible infrastructure)
% Previous attempts by this group (GENIUS v1/v2)
% note NGFCS

Simulators drive R\&D by calculating metrics that can be compared accross fuel 
cycles. 

% MJG - We need to be very precise about the terms 'static' and 'dynamic'. They
% should likely be defined before being used in this context.

Previous simulators have been static or dynamic. Some have been discrete while 
others have been fleet-based. Some have captured regional behavior, material 
isotopics, transmutation detail, etc. Indeed, some tools have attempted 
agent-based functionality. % MJG - Which ones? The closest I can think of is
                           % NFCSim, and it's implementation details are closed.

Historically, the national laboratories have driven development and regulated 
the use of their own tools (cite VISION, DANESS, NFCSim, etc.), while 
universities and industry have simultaneously developed tools of their own as 
well. 

The Cyclus code arose out of the GENIUSv2 code. That software itself was the 
result of lessons-learned from an LDRD project at INL called GENIUSv1. 


\subsection{Motivation}
% Gently reiterate the above need. 
% There should be a hero narrative here
% There was a gap in the capabilities of simulators.
% Cyclus, a hero, came in to fill that gap. 

% MJG - @gonuke has always cited method-to-method comparisons as the primary
% benefit Cyclus can bring to the table. Do we want to frame the hero narrative
% in that context? The more I think about, the more I feel like this is a
% secondary argument. I'll take a crack at a few sentences below.

Cyclus provides a sophisticated and modern, agent-based platform. Previous 
codes were lacking in a number of ways. Cyclus has a number of features that 
overcome those issues.  

% MJG - I don't claim that all of this belongs in the beginning of this
% subsection, but here's some more content. 

Modeling the growth of a physics-dependent, international nuclear fuel supply
chain is a difficult problem. To date, it has been treated relatively
lightly. Tools have either focused on macro effects, e.g., the fleet-level
stocks and flows of commodities, or micro effects, e.g., the used fuel
composition fast reactor fuel. Accordingly, each focus has driven the
development of these tools, rendering the task of answering questions between
the macro and micro levels either impossible or difficult and time consuming. 

Cyclus uses a divide-and-conquer approach, separating the problem of modeling a
physics-dependent supply chain into a simulation kernel and archetypes that
interact with the kernel during a simulation. The kernel is responsible for the
deployment and interaction logic of entities in the simulation. Physics
calculations are constrained to individual archetypes. Accordingly, specialists
in a given field can utilize their time and resources in modeling a specific
process associated with the nuclear fuel cycle, e.g. reprocessing and advance
fuel fabrication, rather than also modeling the entirety of the cycle.

% we could use a specific example of Cosi's equivalence method below
Because Cyclus uses a modular archetype approach, comparing two archetypes is
straightforward. Consider a case in which an analyst would like to compare the
effect of using different models to determining input fuel composition for fast
reactors. A variety fuel fabrication archetypes can be developed and used
interchangably to analyze the effect of each on a simulation's output.

\subsubsection{Modular Architecture}
% Motivation for encapsulated plug-in architecture 
% enables ecosystem, ease of contribution across institutions
% enables myriad levels of simulation fidelity
% enables FC analyses that can compare â€˜apples to apples'

Draw from and cite the ``Open Architecture and Modular Paradigm'' ANS summary.

We expect that there are a number of types of users and developers who will 
interact with the Cyclus framework. Those people fall into a number of 
categories. All such people benefit from the modular architecture. 

% man that figure has gone quite a ways =)

\subsubsection{Agent-based Paradigm}
% superior detail in capturing simulation dynamics
% more flexible control over behavior
% describe Region/Institution/Facility hierarchy
% note importance of generic resource exchange paradigm

ABM is modern, sophisticated, true to reality, and it takes advantage of modern
computing resources. Furthermore, agent-based modeling provides an analyst a
more natural perspective from which to model a given problem. In the nuclear
fuel cycle context for example, an analyst can design an agent with
reactor-related logic and a separate agent with fuel fabrication-related logic.

System dynamics popular approach for modeling nuclear fuel cycles in current
tools (cite VISION/CAFCA). It has been shown in the literature
\cite{macal_agent-based_2010} that any system dynamics model can be translated
into an agent-based model. Furthermore, it has been shown that agent-based
techniques can provide a richer model than can system dynamics. Formally, the
set of system dynamics models is a strict subset of agent-based models.

\subsubsection{Discrete Resource Tracking}
% enables more realistic models and metrics
% material routing metrics
% shadow fuel cycles
% etc.

Not all simulations can be successfully run with a fleet-based model that 
doesn't distinguish between discrete materials. Shadow fuel cycles are an 
example. 

A discrete resource model allows for a range of modeling granularity. In the
macroscopic extreme, it is equivalent to time-stepped continuous flow. In the
microscopic extreme, the model is capable of representing individual fuel
assemblies.
